# apicrudnodejs
My first nodejs crud

This code is integrated with MONGODB.

This code has no front end, it's just the route request using Isommnia to help me test post routes and put routes.

To use the code, put in your terminal:

npm run dev

dev is a dependece created to help me save save and start the node service with each change.
